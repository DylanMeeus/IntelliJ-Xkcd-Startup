Xkcd-Startup for IntelliJ
===


[Install for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10699-xkcdotd)

This plugin will show a random XKCD comic each time IntelliJ is opened, or when a new project has
been launched. (This can be used instead of the 'tips' dialog IntelliJ normally opens when starting
or opening a project.
